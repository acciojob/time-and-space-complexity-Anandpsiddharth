 <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures how efficient an algorithm is based on the time it takes to run as the input size increases. A more efficient algorithm has lower time complexity.</p>
   <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory or space an algorithm uses during execution. For example, the space complexity of some algorithms is O(n).</p>
